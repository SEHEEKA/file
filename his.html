        <p>
         <span style="color:rgb(71, 106, 146);font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"></br>“When I say I love you more, I don’t mean I love you more than you love me. I mean I love you more than the bad days ahead of us, I love you more than any fight we will ever have. I love you more than the distance between us, I love you more than any obstacle that could try and come between us. I love you the most.” </span></br>
        </br><span style="color:rgb(50, 93, 141);font-weight:normal;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Tuesday morning, The day has finally come. The last few days have been long since I booked my ticket. We have been counting days. Now days have turned into mere hours. Even then I felt like time was standing still. 

        I haven't been able to sleep properly for the last 2 days. I am tired, but the excitement has kept me going. After waiting for hours and hours which felt like days, finally it was time to go to the airport. 
                
    </br> Met a couple of friends at the airport, I haven't had any food the whole day. My stomach was feeling really tight, Might have been the excitement of meeting the love of my life. It's the first time we are meeting after we confessed our love. I kept thinking to myself, we have been planning this for a long time. We have talked for hours and hours, making video calls almost every day. Still, why do I feel like a teenager? 
            
                There were definitely butterflies in my stomach. Now I know it's real. </br>The boarding and the entire duration from abu dhabi to kochi was technically 4 hours but it felt like 40. But once I landed, I started feeling uneasy. What if i dont meet her expectations, what if I do or say something stupid. I tend to do that. 
            
            </br> Alright I am done with immigration, now I go outside. Is she here, has she been waiting for me the whole time. What should i do?. We talked about hugging. Should i hug her when i see her, Or should i just shake her hands. Do I look good?What if she doesn't like the way I look? She only saw me once before and she barely looked at me the whole night. AM I FAT???
            
            </br> I called her, and she said she is almost outside. The nerves started kicking in, My palms were sweating. I started walking outside, I looked for her through the wall of people. And there she is, Smiling, looking beautiful as ever. Wearing a creamy green shirt and dark green baggy pants. I loved how she looked. Her long hair tied in a ponytail. She looked so lovely and I immediately thought to myself. Do I deserve her??
            
                I gave her a nervous handshake like I was meeting my 2nd cousin from pattambi. It was so bad. And i kept thinking did she expect me to hug her, did she expect me to kiss her cheeks. 
            I kept telling myself “ JUST FUCKING HOLD HER HANDS YOU FUCKING PUSSY”. </br>It was almost 9 AM and we still had hours before we checked into our hotel. She wasn't talking much, she was doing the same thing she did the last time we met. Not looking at my face. 
            
                But I do like looking at her face. She has this thing she does when she is nervous(i think) where she just looks around except where i am standing. And she does this little pout with her mouth. I didn't want to stare at her, I kept asking what we should do, We finally decided we would go to the mall. We ordered a cab, luckily the driver was nearby and he picked us up near pillar A2. 
            
            
            
            </br>To be continued…….</br>

        <span style="color:rgb(71, 106, 146);font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">

        </br>“Take my hand, take my whole life too. For I can't help falling in love with you.”</br></span>

            <span style="color:rgb(50, 93, 141);font-weight:normal;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"></br>She looked absolutely stunning, I loved everything about her. My dreams about her were nothing compared to what was in front of me. Her smile, Her hair, the way she dressed, Her walk, everything was making me weak. I wanted to stand closer to her but my legs were glued to the ground. I wanted to put my arms around her, but my arms felt like a 1000 pounds. I wanted to hug her and tell her how much I loved her, but I was too afraid of what might come out. </br>I was waiting for the cab to arrive so that I could be closer to her, sitting next to her. 

	Once the cab came and we got inside, She looked at me. I distinctly remember that look. That look gave me the courage to sit a little bit closer to her once the car started moving. Her smell, the first time I experienced it, was something magical. I never had that sensation before in my life. I wanted to hold her hand, hold it tight. Still in the back of my head I had this faint feeling that she might pull her hand away. And if she did, that's it. Everything is ruined. 

</br>I have never been this nervous in my life, hoping she wouldn't notice my shivering legs of sweaty palms, I kept thinking should I ask her for her hand or should i just take her hand. I took the former option, If she denies, then it's settled, she doesn't like me touching her. Just like last time we would just talk and just have a good time.

	I asked her, and without even a slight notion of second thought she let me hold her hands. Her hands on mine felt amazing, Her long beautiful fingers. It looked so good inside my palms. I noticed she was also sweating, that gave me some relief. At Least i am not the only nervous one here. She might be going through the same emotions as I am. Once I had her hand in mine I didn't want to let go. I wanted to preserve that moment for as long as I could.


</br>I kept holding her hand like that until the end of our one hour journey. I love fiddling with her fingers, rotating her ring around her fingers. It felt so good. I couldn't believe that I get to live my life with this beautiful woman. I felt like the luckiest person in the world. At that moment the world belonged to us. I love this girl so much, I want to give her the best possible life she could imagine. She is the best. She makes me feel happy. She is the light at the end of the tunnel, her smile is the most beautiful thing I have ever seen. Even though she was not looking at me I knew she was thinking about me. 

	Even if our trip ended right there, I would have been the happiest person ever. I love her with all I have. And the thought that she loves me back has to be the most beautiful feeling anyone can wish for.

</br>I kept her hand on mine until we reached our destination. I couldn't wait to hug her. We went to a mall. The plan was to kill some time until we checked into our hotel. But I didn't care. I just loved walking with her, holding her hand. Once or twice I even put my hand around her shoulder. I knew it was uncomfortable for her but she didn't pull away or remove my hands. </br>We went to a coffee place. We had a chit chat. But i don't remember what we talked about. I was just mesmerized looking at her face.

        </br></br>“I hope its okay if i love you forever”</br></br>

</span><span style="color:rgb(50, 93, 141);font-weight:normal;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">The time was getting nearer, we had planned this for a long time, we had been counting days. We have talked about it. We did our practice runs over the phone multiple times. We have sent each other pictures, you know, they are not so safe for work. </br> Quick flashback. The first time she sent me her “picture” shocked me, I nearly dropped my phone. Her body was so perfect. She sent me a picture with her breasts covered in text “SEND NUDES”. I could see a small glimpse of her nipples behind the text. That was enough for me to get turned on to heaven. She had the midriff of a fucking model. I felt so insecure then. Look at me a slithering slob, Would she like someone with man boobs and a protruding belly. She was asking for mine as well. I contemplated not sending her anything. What if she thought I was too small, what if she is repulsed by what she saw.

</br>Then I thought to myself, she is engaged to me. No way she is going to back out citing this reason. I am safe here. She had told me she loved me. Love is not just about this right?. But i really wanted to see her, the text covering her body was driving me crazy. Earlier we tried having sex on the phone. We both finished, she seemed to enjoy it. She said she loved it. I asked myself if it's not about the size right, if i could make her feel that way over the phone. I am golden. And anyways she is a virgin after all. There is no point of comparison.

I asked her to remove the text and send me a proper picture and she did without any hesitation. I wanted her to see me as well, I was already hard seeing her picture. LIttle did she know the one picture I sentI sent her is out of the many I tookI took.

</br>Coming back, we both knew what we looked like underneath. So there weren't many surprises waiting for me. 

</br>We reached the hotel at around 1:50. We went for the check in. And low and behold, i was literally expecting for something like this to happen. My stupid ass booked the room for single occupancy. How can I beI be so stupid. We Had planned all this for months. And me being the idiot that i am,  booked the room for 1 adult. 

I was afraid we might not be able to stay, but luckily we could change the booking at the counter. She paid for it which I thought was so freaking hot. I just wanted to grab her right then and there. We did our check in and we waited for our room to get ready. </br>There was this girl there who was planning some kind of a birthday party. Then i thought tomorrow is her birthday,



Should I get her a cake, and I asked her but she didn't seem to be interested. Then i thought i'll wait till midnight. I did have something to give her. </br>Then a guy came and said our room was ready. When we went to collect the keycard they informed us that we were upgraded to a business class suite. </br>She had mentioned she didn't like the service during check in, I had chosen the hotel, what if this was a disaster?

</br>I was so nervous when we were in the elevator. I calmed down when we were at the mall. But all those nerves came back with a vengeance. It was at the peak when we opened the doors. We went into the business class suite, it was better than what i was expecting. A huge room with a huge bed. Had a built-in closet. The lights in the bathrooms were not working. But it was fine. I could call room service later. </br>I had much more important things in my mind. I wanted to hug her. I kept my bag on the bed, I asked her “do you remember? you promised me a hug”. Now at this moment as well, I could still feel her body touching against mine. Her smell, Her whole aura engulfing my entire senses. She smelled so good, her aroma was intoxicating. The way she came into the hug. I knew it was the first time she was hugging someone like this. She was also wrapping her arms around me so tight. I wanted to see her face, But i couldn't let go.

</br>I wanted more, I wanted to kiss her. I wanted to feel her lips on mine. I gently kissed her on her shoulders. And I asked her if I could kiss her. She gave me a gentle nod. That's all I wanted. I planted my lips on hers. I tried moving my lips but she wasn't kissing me back. I felt like her lips were stuck in that position. She was not reciprocating my advances. Did she not like it? Am I a sloppy kisser?. What ifs….

</br>I removed myself from her and I asked her why she was not kissing me back. She said it was her first time and she didn't know how to kiss.Then I thought maybe she wanted to ease into it. She wanted more time. </br>I went to check out why the bathroom lights were not working. And being as stupid as I am, I never bothered to put the key card in the thingy. 

</br>After some small talk we were both in bed. And I asked her if i could kiss her again. She said yes. I thought this time I would start in the neck. She had told me that her neck was a very sensitive area. If I could turn her on by kissing her neck. Maybe she would open up to me. I kissed her neck, No basically i smooched her neck. And went for her lips. This time I could feel her trying to move her lips to accommodate mine. 

Her aroma was filling my nose, it was so hard by that point, and I was so conscious that it might poke her on the legs. I tried keeping my eyes open, but I couldn't. I kept going between her upper and lower lips between mine. And gradually she slowly started opening her lips for me. I could feel her teeth touching my lips. Her lips are getting more wet. It felt amazing. They love the faint aroma of her mouth. I never wanted it to end. And we kept on kissing for what felt like hours…..

    <span style="color:rgb(50, 93, 141);font-weight:normal;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
	</br></br>I kept on kissing her, it's the first time i am kissing someone on the lips. And i can say with full confidence that she has the best lips. She is kissing me back, Its official we are not lip virgins anymore. </br>But I wanted more. But I had to make sure she was ready as well. I'll advance slowly so that she could stop me any time she wanted. And I would stop as well. I didn't want anything that she didn't want either. 

	I wanted to feel her breasts. As we moved over to the bed, i thought to myself are we moving too fast, we still had 2 days left. We should leave something for tomorrow as well. </br>She had told me that she was supposed to be on her periods. So I thought we will just do some first base stuff if she is ready. 

</br>I wanted to feel her whole body, I slowly moved my hands over her breasts and cupped it with my fingers. It felt amazing on my hands. She never wears a bra, So i could see the shadows of her nipples poking from her sheen shirt. That was driving me crazy, I was so turned on by that and i was also getting really hard by that point

</br>In my mind, I was trying my best to not poke her legs with my manparts. As I began feeling her breasts she let out a faint moan. Her moan is my kryptonite. She does this thing where she inhales with her mouth closed before letting out a moan. That is an insane turn on. She was not stopping me, She was moaning. Yes, She was enjoying what i was doing. That gave me more confidence. I started pressing on her breasts even harder all the while kissing her very deep. I did not stop, I kissed her on the lips, sucked her on the neck, Even bit her a little bit.

	I wanted to see her stomach, her belly button. I wanted to lick her whole body.</br> Her aroma was also getting real stronger, She was, is and always will be my favorite. She felt so good on my lips and tongue. As she was getting more into the rhythm of things. I started using my tongue as well while kissing. 

</br>I Slowly put my hands inside her shirt, pulling it up. But she wore her pants too high and I couldn't see her belly button. As if she knew what I wanted, she pulled her pants down for me and I started licking her stomach. She was so lean, but I like it that way. She had the midriff of a model. She had told me she likes it when her hips are squeezed. I Squeezed her hips really hard. She kept on moaning. </br>I pulled her shirt a little bit more and I could see a bit of her underboob and that was so hot. Her shirt was tight around that area and I couldn't pull it up properly. She saw me struggling and she adjusted herself and pulled her shirt over her breasts.

</br>First time I saw her breasts, I had seen pictures before. But seeing and feeling it for real was something else. I wanted to play with it. Like my very own stress ball. Her boobs are my stress reliever. I squeezed her right breasts first, put my lips all over it. Making it wet. Covering it with my saliva. I circled my tongue around her nipples. She has this beauty spot under her right breast which looks so hot. 

</br>Now I wanted to go down on her, I tried pulling her pants down, but she stopped me. I removed my hands almost immediately as I didn't want to overdo it and ruin the moment. She told me she was wearing pads. But I remember her telling me she wasn't on her periods. Then why the hell is she wearing pads?. I told her I didn't care and I wanted to see her fully. She told me that she will remove it herself. I was thinking to myself why she was ashamed. Its me, her future hubby. We are getting married in 5 months. Who cares, Just show em to me. 

</br>I really wanted to know what she tasted like. She removed her underwear and came back to the bed. I moved my hands towards her clit. I started rubbing it. Her expression during that was so hot and was taking me out of this world. I rubbed it for sometime, she kept on pulling my hands. But not so hard that I felt like I should stop. And she was also moaning at the same time as well. I knew it was pleasurable for her. So i didnt stop. It was wet over there, i don't really know the anatomy of female parts. I didn't even know if I was rubbing the right area. But I just rubbed when it felt nice. I could feel she was ticklish and she kept squirming. </br>Now i wanted to put my fingers inside. Feel her warmth on my fingers. 

	I slowly put my finger inside. Immediately I realized it was painful for her, So i didn't really push it all the way. I just kept my fingers there and didn't really know what I should do. 

</br>At this point she was completely naked. I could see her fully, her whole self. I removed my hands and lay beside her for a while, completely admiring her naked body. Those perky nipples, her slim stomach, her inviting neck and that beautiful face. Compared to her upper body, everything beneath was completely different. Her hips, ass and thighs would give nicky minaj a run for her money. 

</br>These thighs were molded from the best stock of clay. And I could see her ass. But I haven't felt them until now and I wanted to enough courage, I knew she was enjoying it. Now to move on to our fantasies. 

</br>When we sexted, we had both mentioned we liked it rough. I moved on top of her, started kissing her neck. Moved to her lips. I kissed her hard, sucked her neck like there is no tomorrow. Moving between her neck and lips. I bit her lips, gently then harder. Squeezed her breasts really hard digging my fingers in her skin, her moans were getting louder. My hard dick was poking her everywhere. I held her face by the jaw pretty roughly while I was kissing her, I squeezed all over her body pretty hard.  I wanted her to feel me too, So I moved up, placing my legs on both sides of her upper body and pulled down my pants. 

</br>I was so turned on that I didn't care that I was whipping my hard dick on her pretty face and shoving it into her mouth. But surprisingly she opened her mouth for me, inviting it in. That's when I knew she was also very  turned on by my actions. She put it in her mouth, tried sucking it. But other than warmth I didn't feel much. She wasn't really sucking it, I tried pushing it slightly and to my horror she gagged. So I removed myself from her and started kissing her really hard again. I thought she wanted more aggressiveness from me. So I squeezed and sucked her nipples so hard that it had become really red, biting her nipples and lips. Now only did I realize that my hands were pulling on her hair and she was in actual pain and that's why she stopped me. 

</br>Funny bit, We came up with a safe word in case something like this happened again. Imagine it's the first time we are doing it and we had a safe word. Our safe word was “potato”. Cute, right..

</br>Now it was my turn I think, My pants were already down and my dick was so hard. She placed her hands on my warm dick. Her long fingers wrapped around the shaft. Her hand just laying there felt so good. She held my dick, and tried stroking it. There was no lube, saliva nothing. Just my skin rubbing against my skin. Even though it felt somewhat good, it was also kind of painfull. So I stopped her and showed her how to jerk my meat. 

</br>I put my own saliva on it, and jerked off in front of her. That was hot. Then I asked her to suck me off. She kissed my top first and it was heavenly. She kept on kissing all over my dick and then put it in her mouth. Even though I had made it wet myself, due to the ac or something it was getting dry really fast. And she wasn't using a bit of saliva when she was sucking me.  And a few seconds later she said it was hurting her jaw. So I asked her to stop.

</br>And then I removed my shirt as well and we were both naked. I hugged her tight and lay there for some time. Then again I slowly started kissing her and going back to the rough antics. And when i was doing it after some time she mentioned my dick touched her vagina. And like a click of a button I was turned off. </br>A million things came rushing to my mind. Engulfing my senses. Just like that I was a mess. I couldn't concentrate on anything. So I stopped. 

</br>I wanted to know it was nothing to be scared of. I wanted to know if something would happen. Why didn't I pack some condoms? Even if we weren't gonna have sex, I could have been more careful. 



</br>All these thoughts came rushing into my mind. And i was helpless. As we were lying there I was looking at my phone. And it was not giving me any relief. She could get pregnant with this. Thats what that fucking mayo clinic was telling me.

</br>And I became unattentive, during this we were also planning our dinner. Now she has also mentioned I was on the phone most of the time. And now I feel bad. 

</br>We walked back to our hotel. It was a nice walk. The food was good as well. I love holding her hands. Her soft hands. I could walk with her for miles and miles. She held my hand while crossing the roads which felt so caring. She really cares for me. 

</br>Once we got back to the hotel, we did some similar foreplays and enjoyed each other's company. </br>And I had gotten her something for her birthday which was coming up. I couldnt wait until 12AM. I wanted to give it to her. It was an anklet. I wanted something that she would keep on herself all the time, so I put it on her beautiful legs. It looked so good on her. 

</br>And at 12 I gave her a birthday wish. </br>And as we were laying down,  She started receiving phone calls. I hoped she wouldn't pick any calls and would give her undivided attention to me.

 But it's okay. I know she will make it upto me… </br>I then put my head on her thighs and i felt nice, safe and cared. I didn't know when I dozed off. It was one of the best nights of my life. Heck the best day of my life. I love this woman, I want to spend the rest of my life with her. She is me, and I am her. July can't come fast enough…

	<span style="color:rgb(50, 93, 141);font-weight:normal;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"></br></br>The next day we were supposed to check out at 12pm. But I was not ready to leave. I didn't like the possibility of leaving that place just after a few hours. That room and hotel was a witness to the most beautiful moments of my life. I was already dreading that our trip, our little rendezvous was coming to an end. 

    </br> I woke up and it was a beautiful sight, the love of my life laying beside me, looking at me, So full of love. I love her so much. I just wanted to kiss her right then and there, but she wasnt allowing me. She said she doesn't want me to kiss her without brushing, I dont care if she brushed or just had a stinky fish for breakfast. I just wanted to kiss her. I hugged her and gave her a peck on the lips. But she didn't kiss me back. After a couple of pecks, maybe i am irresistible. She kissed me back. Our first “just woke up” kiss. I want to wake up like this everyday for the rest of my life.  

</br>We went for breakfast, and all I could think about was our stay coming to an end and i didnt want it to end. The buffet spread was great at the hotel. She had dessert for breakfast which I thought was cute, but I insisted on her having a dosa. After breakfast I went straight to the lobby and extended our stay until the evening. Atleast i get to spend some more hours alone with her before we depart to our home.

</br>We went back upstairs, I don't know what it was. Maybe it was the food or maybe it was the dread I felt of our short escapade coming to an end.  My stomach was not in a good mood, I was really gassy. It was awful. Once we were in the room, we played around with each other for sometime in the bed. Every time there was some pressure on my stomach, I was praying my intestines would not betray me. 

</br>After some time I went to the washroom to relieve myself. After a great sit I came out. I really wished she didn't go into the washroom right after. 

</br>She is my girl, always and forever. Now I cannot even imagine a life without her. She makes me happy….  

</br>Time was running fast, we kept ourselves to the bed, twistin and turnin. Kissing and smooching. I remember  in between we even tried watching a movie. Which was a complete failure. She suggested an old malayalam movie ayalvasi oru daridravasi for whatever reason. I remember sleeping at one point hugging her tight. After we woke up at around 3:30pm we had a discussion about taking showers. And I suggested we take a shower together. She was hesitant at first but when I insisted she was game. 

</br>Getting naked in a fully lit environment where we both see each other completely without any kind of filter was a pretty nervous thought. But fuck it its going to be sexy. Rubbing and slithering her body with slippery soap and water running all over us. As well as our naked bodies touching under the shower was already giving me a hard on. She touching my dick with soapy water as well would be out of this world. I can also rub her out and give her the pleasure of a lifetime. That was the plan.

</br>We both got naked and went into the bathroom. We entered the shower. It was pretty awkward. When we opened the shower it was very cold water and we were both very chilled. Once the water warmed up and we both got comfortable it was an experience. We hugged,kissed under the shower. We ran our hands on each other's entire bodies. I took some soap and rubbed it all over her breasts, ass and thighs. It felt so good on my hands. Skin on skin touching under the shower with soap is one of the best feelings ever. 

</br>At one point she even took my dick and tried to put it between her thighs which gave me instant flash back of the last day and didn't want to repeat the same mistake. I stopped her instantly. She was on her period by that time and miraculously there wasn't a single drop of blood during the entire thing. I even sucked her clit which tasted amazing btw. 

</br>We spend almost an hour in the shower, And ill never forget those moments. Once we got out, dressed and dried ourselves. She went back inside to put on makeup. And she didn't even let me kiss her. It was time for us to leave and i couldn't get one last kiss at radisson blu.

	</br>After we checked out of the hotel, we had planned to have food. She had decided a place nearby that she had seen before. She had it looked pretty good. It was called the salt restaurant. During our last run down of our hotel room, we had a missing tv remote and it was driving me nuts. We looked everywhere and we couldn't find it. And by 6pm we had decided its missing and checked out anyways. 
</br>After checkout we walked towards the metro. I was still dreading that the day was going to end. But she didn't seem affected at all. It was driving me crazy. It felt like it meant nothing to her. I kept telling her this and she brushed it off at the time. We took the metro and reached the restaurant. It looked really good from the outside. But once we went inside it was like any other restaurant. It was pretty crowded and all the good seats were gone. My stomach was still having issues. At the same time I was starving as well.

</br>We ordered food, I ordered half al faham and she ordered the chicken steak. The restaurant took their sweet time to get the order delivered. In the meantime we took some pictures for our families.


</br>She draped her shawl over her head for this one, but she looked amazing nonetheless. 
My beautiful angel. </br>But she still wasn't on the same pace as me regarding the feeling of our mini little rendezvous was going to end. 

</br>After food my stomach was having a party. Once we got out of the restaurant we started contemplating whether we should get a taxi or take the metro. I really couldn't take the metro as i was feeling really bad. And finally she agreed to take an uber. We called our uber and he came within minutes.

</br>We took an uber to the marine drive. We had decided to do at least this cliche couple thing. But honestly it was one of the best parts of the whole thing. When we reached marine drive, we went inside. We had a very long walk, holding hands, talking about anything and everything. We kept on looking for places to sit. All the good spots were occupied. Finally we found our solace near a boat house. It wasn't perfect but still I was with her. I kept on telling her about how sad I was. The day was going to end. And her response was “I just live in the moment”. Like WHAT!!!.

</br>We spend hours sitting and talking. It was amazing. We even kissed once. I really didn't want that night to end. I loved holding her hands, looking at her face. Trying to imprint all her looks and expressions onto my mind. 

</br>I remember she had period cramps in between. She asked me to buy her a dew. After that, it was time to catch our train. We walked a bit forward only to find out we missed the best parts of marine drive. But its okay we still have a life time ahead of us to come back many many times..

</br>We took an uber to the railway station, Stupid me had booked the ticket from a far away railway station in ekm. Tripunitara. 

</br>Once we reached the station and had a seat. The dread was at the peak. And she also joined in saying she was also feeling bad. But most probably just to make me feel better. We sat their for around half an hour until our train came malabar express. 

</br>We boarded our train and found our seats. There was a family of 4 seated next to our berths. The wife and a kid was sleeping already on the lower berth and the husband was looking at the phone on the top berth when we came in. And we stored our stuff in the top berth and took our seats and the train started moving soon after.

</br>We sat next to each other on the same berth. I wanted to be close to her. I was really really tired by then. Not having slept properly for the last few days. And i was also not really feeling well due to my stomach issues. The guy seated next to us was a bit creepy giving us side eyes. We ignored..

</br>We talked for some time. We even had a mini fight because of my vaping habit. I am not proud of that moment. She had hid my vape and had to fight her to even get it back as she remembered it. I was a bit in taking my vape back. In my mind I was just being playful. I am really sorry babe you felt that way. I will stop this godforsaken habit of mine. After the fight I placed my head on her lap and she wasn't looking at me. I knew she couldn't be angry at me the whole way. And I was right, She looked at me soon after. I could see love in her eyes. Looking at her face lying on her lap was an amazing view. God, I love this woman. And I am the luckiest person in the world. 

</br>After that I sat again and we kissed each other. And after some time we even managed to fit ourselves in the same berth. We hugged and lay there for sometime. We even did some naughty stuff under the sheets. I grabbed her breasts and caressed her nipples and belly button. I don't know when but I dozed off some time after as it was really comfortable laying next to her tight and squeezed in the berth. 

</br>By the time i woke up, we were almost nearing calicut. She was evidently pissed at me for some reason. The family next to us deboarded at calicut and for the next hour or so we sat and waited for our stop. She tied her hair and got ready during this time. We had decided we were gonna get an auto and go to my place and i will drop her off at her place.

</br>We reached mahe, Took an auto and went to my place. It was the first time she saw my home, Hope she liked it. Manjumma was already waiting outside with the car keys. We had our first drive. I dropped her off at her place and on my drive back, i felt like shit, its done. I didnt want it to end.She said it was not a good experience for her, i despise myself for not being able to give that to her, I fucked up when i slept, i fucked up when i looked at my phone, i fucked up when i fought for my vape. I fucked up the entire trip and i am really sorry babe it left a sore taste in your mouth. Hopefully i can somehow make it upto you. 

</br>The two days we spent together was the best two days of my life. I spend it with the love of my life. It went far beyond what I expected. It was a total dream come true. All the counted days, the waiting was worth it. Our first hug, our first kiss, our first night together, our first shower, the first time we saw each other naked, our first proper date night, our first train ride, our first drive. All in those short two days. What else could I ask for? </br>I loved her and she loved me. And this is just the beginning. Much more to look forward to.
