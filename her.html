                ...It was the 6th of February. Just a few hours until we finally meet. I had started preparing for the rendezvous days back. I made a chart for myself which included my sleep to shaving routine. Nothing should go wrong, afterall. Except it did. I found myself wide awake hours past my ‘scheduled’ bedtime. I knew I messed up as there’s no way I’m going to catch-up on my 8 hours of sleep after this. As much as I anticipated the long night and  deeper eyebags which were to follow, I was in awe. I had envisioned this in my mind numerous times and it is finally happening. Would it be as magical as I had fantasized? Little did I know what lay ahead for me the next day!

            </br>According to my said routine, I was supposed to take a shower by 7am, get ready by 8. Leave the hostel before 8:10. The day started early as I went to shower by 6. Excited much? I could feel my strawberry legs in the cold shower. Waxed too early. Thought to myself as to whether I should shave? Or maybe I’m being too impulsive. It could as well be a formal meeting. Had to kick-in my 26-year-old-virgin-thoughts.

Anyway I started with the makeup because as said nothing can go wrong. I didn't want to look mediocre in front of him. My exclusive wardrobe didn’t leave me much confused as to what to wear. Anyhow, by 8:05 I was outside the hostel. 

</br>My mind was initially numb. My focus was on whether I’ll reach on time. I didn’t want to keep him waiting. The more I was nearing the airport I could feel my heart racing. Still having limited idea what was to follow next. 

</br>At 8:41, I got his text that he landed. I was almost there. Nail-biting moment as I knew it was getting real. From then till around 9, when I met him, I experienced a rush of thoughts, overwhelming yet frail. I could feel my legs going weak, stomach full of butterflies. 
As much impatiently I waited, I also didn’t want him to see me first. So, I didn’t let my guard down.  And then there was him. I caught a glimpse of him and could feel the adrenaline rush as he approached, looking cake. Fine AF. 

How I look was a matter of concern because the sweat drops could wash off my makeup, exposing me. I remembered I had promised him a hug the next time we met, but I also knew I’m not going to do it as soon as we meet, unless he’s the one to initiate it. He didn’t either, which I kind of expected. 

</br>Though this is the second time we meeting, yet felt like the first. I couldn’t look him in the eyes because the eye contact made me nervous. He had asked me if I’m doing it because he’s not presentable. If I was in my expressive self, I would’ve told him how he had no idea what standing next to him made me feel like. Right from the nervous handshake to the awkward greetings, it was a mix of emotions for me. Although, I’ve replayed it in my head over and over again, it all felt like a dream. If only I could tell him how he went from being a stranger to my favorite person in the world in a span of  four months. 

</br>As we got into the car, still clueless as to what was to happen next. I didn’t want to think of it anyway. Would prefer cherishing the existing moment as it is. 
</br>
        </span>

       

        <span style="color:rgb(94, 21, 21);font-weight:normal;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">

        </br> After a few minutes of nervous smiles and awkward exchanges, we decided to go to the Lulu mall. As we sat in the car, he kept his duty free cover in between us. Who even does that? Maybe I expected too much. Forget getting some action, there may not even be a hug or kiss, with the way things are going. Keyboard Warrior AF. 
    </br>Anyway, that wasn’t the sole purpose of him coming here right? It was to meet and spend some time together and we are at it now. </br>I tried to get a glimpse of him now and then. I don’t do well with eye contacts. Them cameras be lying tho. He looked 100x better than what I used to see in photos. I should’ve applied more make up. 

</br>As if he could read my mind, he suddenly asked for my hand. I held his palm right away. That made it the second time we holding hands. I see some progress. Getting there there. 

</br>I’m no less than a keyboard warrior either. My palm was already very sweaty and weak. It didn’t bother me until my mouth started feeling dry. The last thing I wanted to have was a bad breath. Good thing I had orbit. I offered him one too to which he asked if his breath was stinking. No way!

</br>One thing that turned around during our journey was that I conceded that human touch, skin-on-skin, wasn’t that bad at all afterall. Be it with all sweat, it felt great, especially if it’s with the person you adore. With that I already knew, there were more to come. I didn’t quite know what it was then, but I did know that this meetup would change my outlook on love and relationships. </br>Around 50 mins later, we reached the mall. 

He insisted on sitting somewhere. I didn’t want to make him walk much either. Just didn’t know where to sit or what to do. Good thing he suggested we could go to starbucks. Choosing where to eat was anyway something that had always left me confused. 

</br>It was again a very casual thing at Starbucks. I could finally look at his face and maintain eye contact for much longer than before. Getting better. Nervousness level had got down to somewhere around 60%, at this point. Still a long way to go. 

</br>Small talks made its way to me realizing his addiction to vaping. I didn’t know this before. Although it’s kind of attractive, I still wouldn’t want him to do that. Had it been occasional, it was fine. He had promised me that he’ll stop that habit of his. Let’s see…

I also showed him my birthmark on my arms. He found it amusing. It was weird.

That, however, didn’t have any impact on my feelings for him. It had only grown stronger with every passing second. </br>
</br>After that we went to Lulu Celebrate. Not a very good experience with the frustrated security lady. Didn’t see good collections either. Major thumbs down. 

</br>We walked around the mall, holding hands, although it took us a while to figure out how to properly hold hands.  

By then it was almost 1:30pm and it was about time for us to leave for the hotel. We took a metro from the mall to Radisson Blu, our abode for the two days we were in Kochi and a place that gave us so many good memories to rewind upon.  </br>At that moment, however, I didn’t want to think about what was to follow next for my mind was numb, with so many emotions and mixed feelings and I always preferred living in the moment. I was sure about one thing though, I could care less about where I am, if it’s with him.

        </span>


       

        <span style="color:rgb(94, 21, 21);font-weight:normal;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
        </br></br>I thought the service wasn’t going to be that great, particularly because of Manoyara’s broken english. Seemed amateur-ish.
A little past 2pm we went inside the hotel room. </br>Room No: 1904. It was very spacious and cozy. 
Strike two: Empty tissue box in the bathroom. Not an unresolvable issue. Luckily there weren’t any more.

</br>A few into looking around the room, trying to figure out how to turn on the lights and stuff, he asked me if I remembered the hug I promised him sometime back. I did something with my arms. He took it as an affirmative and leaned in for a hug, a rather tight one. I think he kissed me as well, on the neck. Or maybe he just buried his face in my neck. 
He asked me if he could kiss me. I said yes. I didn’t know what I was thinking but I wanted it.
I couldn’t react so well to it, because this was a first. It sent me shivers. </br> I don’t remember the last time I kissed someone, platonically either. Had to be 20+ years ago. I was a noob. 
I think he could sense it as well as he stopped kissing me and might have thought that I’m getting uncomfortable. I was not one bit uncomfortable but my lips as said had been a barren land. Could he possibly nurture it?

</br>Fructified it is! Because I could finally do it. After the previous unsuccessful attempt he asked me to sit on the bed and kissed me again. This time, without even me realizing I could do it too. 
I cannot put into words, but that totally swept me off my feet. My mind was still stuck at the moment we hugged for the first time. As if frozen in time. </br>And as we advanced, he grabbed my breast and squeezed it. We had sexted a number of times and we had already ‘seen’ each other. Moreover, I had fantasized about this for months now. I didn’t feel embarrassed or nervous. If anything I was so excited. I still remember when he lifted my shirt, exposing my stomach. Gave me them chills when he touched it. It gave me immense pleasure when he kissed there. Same with what he did to my breasts. His fingers touched almost all of my sensitive points. He tried to remove my pants. I had to stop him because I wasn't so sure about it. He asked me whether I wasn’t ready yet. </br>It wasn’t that. I was a bit insecure and I didn’t know if I was bleeding. I had worn a pad. This could be his first time as well, and I didn’t want to scar that experience. 

</br>I got up and checked. There was nothing, so I removed it. He kissed my thighs and rubbed my ____. It felt so out of the world. It was a very different feeling from what I had when I used to touch myself. Now I see what the hype is all about. He tried inserting his fingers. That was very painful, yet ticklish. I didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. I instantly stopped him, although I didn’t want him to stop. I just couldn’t with the pain. 
He even tried licking. That made me feel like I was melting. But for it being a peak point, I couldn’t let him do that for more than a few seconds. It tickled a lot too.

</br>I was butt naked, but why’s he still dressed! </br>We kissed again and he got on top of me. He sat near my mouth and removed his pants. I saw a grown human penis for the first time - straight into my mouth. It tasted a bit salty. He must have tried to push it down my throat. I was gagging. He then lied down and I sucked it for a while. By then my mouth started hurting. I’m the kind of person who can’t keep smiling for more than a full minute, because my jaw hurts. So you can’t be expecting me to suck like a pro. It smelt just like skin only. Towards the shaft, it didn’t taste
Salty either. He asked me to give him a handjob. I didn’t quite know how to do it. But he showed me and asked to use a lot of saliva. It felt a bit weird that he stopped me, saying he would cum. 

</br>At a later event, he revealed that it wasn’t lubricated enough and the friction hurt him. It’s good that he pointed it out, but it was a burn to my confidence. 

</br>Suddenly I felt an urge to breastfeed him. We had done it on calls, but I wondered if it would feel the same irl. He lay on my lap, with his head in my arms and started sucking very slowly. That was so hot yet radiated strong mommy vibes. 

</br>He removed his shirt and got naked. He could make a fluffy pillow and a donut stomach. It would feel so good to lie on his chest. I loved every inch of it. There was a lot of kissing and hugging and biting. 
</br>Started off slowly, however, suddenly he got so aggressive and started kissing very passionately. He bit my lips and tongue. The romantic nibbles on the neck turned to painful bites. Yet I didn’t want him to stop. He legit crushed my nipples, especially the right one that it turned red. He bit there, squeezing the other breast. I couldn’t help but scream all the while. He literally ate my nipples. It was that intense. 

</br>He licked my belly button and bit my waist and thighs. He came up and kissed me again. I could feel his warmth and above all could feel his hard dick poking against my ____. That felt amazing and made me so weak. I could feel his entire weight on me. But I didn’t mind at all. If I die, I die. 
To sum it up, it was a mix of pain, pleasure, suffocation and affection. 
But it hurt so uncontrollably when he laid his hands on my hair. That kind of ruined the moment. 

</br>There were again a lot of similar foreplays, one where we both were naked and his dick rubbed against me. I told him it’s touching and he instantly stopped. It was okay as there was still time and I was looking forward to the night. 

</br></br>We spent the rest of the evening looking for the moles in our bodies. I didn’t want the day to end. 

</br>Later on, we decided to go to Dominoes. I was so excited for our walk. He seemed a bit distracted, and was on the phone most of the time. I wondered why.  As we got into the lift, all I could think of was that I’m so grateful for this guy. And couldn’t get over the thought that I get to spend the rest of my life with him.
</br>He is afraid of crossing the roads. So am I. But with him, it felt like I had the upper hand.
</br>Throughout our walk, I was cherishing our much awaited rendezvous, our stay together and everything in between… </br>

        </span>


<span style="color:rgb(94, 21, 21);font-weight:normal;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
</br>After coming back from the Dominoes, he went to take a shower. He came out wearing a t-shirt and wrapped in a towel. I went to the washroom and had to come out quickly for something. He instantly covered himself and I said sorry as I felt bad. As if I didn’t see him naked a while back. 
It proved that we are still a bit formal. But is okay.</br>

I came out from the washroom only to find him sleeping with a laptop placed on his lap. I tried touching his foot to see if he’d wake up. He didn’t. Seems to be in deep sleep. I decided not to bother him further and went on with my nightly routine. Still sleeping! I got so bored and finally woke him up. He was apologizing for sleeping. I didn’t mind tbh. 

</br>Him and I watched some youtube videos on wood works. Not really my type, but I watched it for him. We both were sleepy. Around 11:45 pm, he got up and told me that he feels I might fall asleep before 12, so I decided to open my birthday gift. It was an anklet and he put it on my ankles. Still didn’t kiss my leg!!! Nonetheless, he was the first one to wish me on my 26th birthday. So I’m happy. The anklets were nice and I decided to wear them all the time. Gave me a feeling of carrying something of him with me.


</br>I received a few calls and text messages from my friends, wishing me. I kept it very short with them. And came back to bed soon.

</br>I don’t know when did we sleep off, but I remember waking up around 3-4am, half asleep. He was right beside me, sleeping so cute. We had turned off the AC, so my first instinct was to touch his forehead to see if he was sweating. I think he woke up maybe like 10% awake. So I asked if he wanted the AC on. He denied and hugged me in his sleep. Felt so good sleeping like that with someone for the first time. 

</br>I woke up around 7:30 am the next day and out of habit, I texted him a good morning message. I couldn’t take my eyes off him while he was sleeping by my side. I hugged and kissed him many times to which he subconsciously reciprocated. Around an hour later, he was fully awake and asked me to kiss him on the lips. I got so conscious and told him I’ll brush and come. He didn’t seem to care. We kissed like that only. He didn’t have any morning breath. I couldn’t help but think that this is the face I’ll see the first thing in the mornings in 5 months. It all felt so dreamy. 

</br>We laid there for a while and got ready for breakfast. It was so good. They had so many dishes. I had muffins, boiled potatoes and a half masala dosa. He brought me a watermelon juice and a grape one for himself. Good choice, although I didn’t ask him for it.

</br>He ate so much as it was his cheat weekend, and got a stomach ache. He had explosive diarrhea right after breakfast. Great way to start my birthday. But still, I loved everything about it and I love him with or without his gas troubles. 


</span>
           

<span style="color:rgb(94, 21, 21);font-weight:normal;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
</br></br>After breakfast, we decided to watch a comedy movie. I suggested an old malayalam movie and some 15-20 mins into the movie, we got so distracted. So we decided to turn it off and started kissing and the other stuff from yesterday.


</br>All while he was so scared to even get naked because of the incident from yesterday. What a coward! 
</br>Anyway we hugged and finally slept off around 11am. I woke up around 12pm and found us intertwined. He was lying on my chest and arms but my legs were on top of him. A while later, he woke up too, because it was so hot as we had turned the AC off. 

</br>As it was already very clear that nothing was going to happen between us, we practiced some positions we could try in the near future. Somebody was telling me that I don’t have to step into my 26th year being a virgin. What a keyboard samurai! Nonetheless, to think of it now, it might be good that nothing happened. First time has to be special. Let it be on our wedding night.

</br>Around 4:30, he said he’s going to take a shower. I very vaguely suggested we take a shower together. I was not expecting to actually do it. He talked me into it and now I feel I’d regret it so badly hadn’t I showered with him that day. It was my first time showering with someone.

</br>Initially, when we got to the washroom, I was a bit worried as to whether or not I should get naked as I was on my periods and I definitely didn’t want a period-blood-soaked shower. I removed my pad and it was drenched in blood.  Now I was so sure that our shower is going to be nothing less than a crime scene. I wonder whether he got weirded out by the sight of my blood. 
</br>I braced myself to get into the shower however. We made out in the shower yet again but this time our bodies were so wet and it gave me 100x more sensation. He applied shower gel onto my upper body, still ignoring my legs. He doesn’t have a leg fetish, Noted.
</br>While at it, he fingered me and I think I was able to hold in my ticklish sensation a bit better than before, because I could feel his fingers inside me. I still remember when I looked down, my foot was hardly touching the floor. I touched his dick and he immediately stepped back. Oh yes warrior, I forgot. So I didn't fret much. I liked kissing him in the shower, even if it meant the chlorine water got into my eyes and mouth.

</br>We got out of the shower and he dried my hair using the blow drier. At this point, it was homerun. We got ready and were able to leave. Everytime, I put on my lipstick, he’d kiss and wipe it out of my lips. Finally, the last time I had to deny it. Because in my mind, we still had a whole evening and a train journey. But little did I know what was to follow during its course…

</br>By 6pm, we checked out of the hotel. </br>And like that we left Radisson Blu, a place where we crafted our love.</br>

</span>
                


<span style="color:rgb(94, 21, 21);font-weight:normal;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
</br></br> After the checkout, we decided to have food. I was a bit worried to be seen outside that time, for the fear of getting spotted by my office colleagues. 

</br>We took the metro to Kadavantra. I had seen a restaurant there, so we thought we'd go there. It looked really nice from the outside. Inside, however, it was cramfull. It was still fine for </br>1) I was with him. </br>2) I was hungry to care enough.

</br>We took pictures from there so that we could send it to our families. Have to look modest. So we even maintained a distance while clicking it. By then the food was served. It was nice and feasible. 
</br>After eating, he ordered a lime juice. He might’ve taken like 1-2 sips and then said that he had to go to the washroom. He said his stomach was not well. I thought it was lime juice. But he said it’s because he dreaded that the day is coming to an end. Yes, but the night was still young and we had a whole train journey to look forward to. As excited as I’m, I responded that I always live in the moment. So why dreading instead of cherishing what we have right now?

</br>Our train was at 11:25pm and we had some 4-5 hours to spend. So we decided to go to Marine Drive. I really wanted to take the metro to go there. Idk, I felt that taking public transport got us closer; obviously next to walking holding hands.

</br>But since he mentioned about his stomach ache, I said let’s uber. On the way, we talked about what the plans were for the next day. He was talking about his first visit to my house and how we needn't treat him specially.  

</br>By the time we reached marine drive, I too started feeling like time was running too quickly. The two days went by like two minutes. 
</br>Right on time, my period cramps kicked in, but only lasted for a few. We found a place to sit after walking for a while. Honestly, I would’ve walked for the entire duration but I didn’t want to as we had luggage and he was unwell. 

</br>We talked a lot. Went through each others’ gallery. He told me about his Mangalore escapades. I really doubted his virginity at that point, given his friends weren’t. Then I remembered what he did at the Radisson Blu. Lmao no way that he’s not a virgin. Who even gets scared with a vague mention of our genitals touching. That too when I was on periods. But on the brighter side, it also meant that he’s gentle. 

</br>I started burping after drinking the mountain dew he brought. It was then when he mentioned his stomach pain started after the breakfast buffet at the hotel and how he destroyed the toilet post it. He even said he was holding it in. Too pure. 

</br></br>A wave of sadness hit me as I realized it was time for us to leave. As we walked further to exit the marine drive, we saw even better places. As lively as it was, I’d still choose the place where we sat. Because it wasn’t that glutted and we could even steal a kiss. I always despised people who do a lot of PDA. I used to see a bunch of similar young couples, when I used to visit Marine drive as a kid. I never thought I’d become the villain I swore to destroy. 

</br>On our way to the railway station, we passed in front of Radisson blu and I really felt like reliving it all once again.

</br>Whilst we were sitting on the platform waiting for the train, all I could feel was an air of melancholy. I even shared this with him. And that time he disregarded it by making a sarcastic comment on my earlier words “Live in the Moment”.  

</br>But I still had the train journey to be excited about. The train arrived sharp on time. We got into the train and found our seats. There was a couple sleeping adjacent to our berth. The lady was sleeping but her husband on the upper berth was, however, awake. We placed all the luggage on the upper berth and sat down on the lower one. First, he laid down on my lap. The guy on the UB was already ogling. 

</br>A few moments later, I laid on his lap. All through this, he was consistently vaping. I was mad, but he decided to sleep on my lap. But I couldn’t stay mad at him for much longer.
